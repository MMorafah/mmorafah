I am a final-year PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), advised by [Prof. Bill Lin](http://cwcserv.ucsd.edu/~billlin/). I hold an M.S. from UCSD and a B.S. from Amirkabir University of Technology, both in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

My research focuses on the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business**, with broad interests in decentralized AI systems, generative AI, information systems, operations management, and economics. My work has resulted in publications at top-tier AI conferences, including NeurIPS and AAAI, as well as journals like IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence. I have also served as a reviewer for several top-tier AI conferences and journals.

In addition to my academic experience, I have completed AI research internships at [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) and Qualcomm AI Research.

<span style="color: red;">**I am actively seeking post-doctoral opportunities in business schools. Please feel free to reach out if you have any openings.**</span>

<span style="color: black;">**I am also open to collaborating on exciting projects. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.**</span>
