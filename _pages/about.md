I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at **The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania**, conducting applied AI research. My research focuses on **generative AI, human-centered and collaborative AI, federated and privacy-preserving learning, and foundation-model–driven analytics**, with applications spanning healthcare, business intelligence and analytics, and large-scale operational systems. 

I received my **Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering** from the **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)**, specializing in machine learning and data science. 
<!-- I also hold an **M.S. from UCSD** and a **B.S. from Amirkabir University of Technology**, both in Electrical and Computer Engineering. -->

My work combines applied AI research with real-world, high-dimensional data, addressing challenges in scalable learning, data heterogeneity, alignment between model predictions and decision-making, LLM alignment, and responsible AI deployment. I have published several papers in leading venues including *NeurIPS, AAAI*, and journals such as *IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence* and *ACM*. I regularly serve as a reviewer for top AI conferences (*NeurIPS, ICLR, AISTATS*) and journals (*IEEE TMC, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, SIAM Journal on Optimization*).

In addition to academia, I have conducted industry AI research through internships at **Tesla Autopilot** and **Qualcomm AI Research**, where I worked on production-scale machine learning systems, applied AI research, and real-world deployment constraints. I am broadly interested in bridging cutting-edge AI research with high-impact applications.


<!-- In addition to my academic experience, I have completed AI research internships at [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) and Qualcomm AI Research. -->
