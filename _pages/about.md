I am a final-year PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), advised by [Prof. Bill Lin](http://cwcserv.ucsd.edu/~billlin/). I hold an M.S. from UCSD and a B.S. from Amirkabir University of Technology, both in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, generative AI, human-centered AI, federated learning/collaborative AI, and privacy** with applications in healthcare, business analytics. My works have been published at top-tier AI conferences, including NeurIPS and AAAI, as well as journals including IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, and ACM. I have also served as a reviewer for several top-tier AI conferences such as ICLR, and AISTAT and journals such as IEEE TMC, and SIAM Journal on Optimization.

In addition to my academic experience, I have completed AI research internships at [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) and Qualcomm AI Research.
